## Time Spent and Lessons Learned

Time spent: 6 hours spent in total.

## Challenges
    Applying the javascript was very difficult and took a lot of revision and help. Styling the card also proved more difficult than I hoped. 
        -Coloring the card-header section wasn't working. It seemed to be going outside of the card.
        -Getting the array from javascript seemed to override some styling.  
    
    These challenges were not necessary to overcome though and with more assignments on deck, I just used a more basic style.
